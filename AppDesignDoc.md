## Overview
### Description
First the user will login to the app or create a new account. Once they login, they will be shown a map which they can choose landmarks of where they want to go. Based on their choice, they will be shown pictures of numerous places to go. They can double click to certain places to favorite them for later or they can tap once to give a description of the place. There will be a page where each user can go to their favorite places they marked to see. Google places is the main API and database I will be pulling from.
